The LASErMPNN models referred to as `epic_weights.pt` and `epic_proofreading_weights.pt` in the [paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.04.22.649862v1) are not compatible with inference in this repository. 
Inference, training code and weights for these models can be found on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/15297591) though they will likely exhibit worse performance relative to the hyperparameter tuned model (`laser_weights_0p1A_noise_ligandmpnn_split.pt`).
